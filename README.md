The main file is releasecandidate.py

Uses Spotipy

"pip install spotipy"

NewsApi

"pip install newsapi-python"

(this might fail on INB computers, if so do pip install --user newsapi-python)

NLTK

"pip install nltk"

.png files in src are required in the same directory as releasecandidate.py

When your Spotify Username is entered, copy and paste the URL of the tab that opens up into the console

If newsapi was installed with '--user', releasecandidate.py will have to be run in powershell, "python releasecandidate.py"
